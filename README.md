# Macro-Express
Uses an AutoHotKey script with pre-created macros which call Python functions to update Google Sheets
Updates Google sheets by highlighting text and hitting a button. Macros are pre-set and displayed in the GUI.
Rows and worksheet information are saved in a text file so users can pick up where they left off. 

I created this to make collecting data faster for a marketing project in 2022, and to make it easy for others to run and use the scripts.
