# Macro-Express

This project uses a fun combination of Python and AutoHotKey to update Google Sheets. Most projects automate tasks for us. You can think of this app as a semi-automater. Have a bunch of stuff you want to copy over to Google Sheets from a bunch of different sources and you want to be a little more hands on about it? This app simulates you manually doing all of the tedious steps it takes to move from window-to-window, cell-to-cell, copying one thing over to another. With a simple push of a button and some highlighting you can have half of your dreams come true! 


**Notes about using AHK (not the ahk library) with Tkinter:**
Thread the GUI to free up the terminal!
